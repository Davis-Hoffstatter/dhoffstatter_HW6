    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <section>
      <p>I was born and raised in Moline, Illinois, and graduated from Moline High School in 2022.</p>

      <p>During high school, I played baseball competitively, which opened the door to continuing my athletic career at Black Hawk College, a local community college. I earned my associate degree there in the spring of 2024.</p>

      <p>Currently, I’m a senior at the University of Iowa, majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems. 
       
<p class="callout-text">
  I chose Business Analytics because I love solving problems with data and uncovering patterns that others might miss.
</p>
      <p>Outside the classroom, I’m a passionate Chicago sports fan, especially when it comes to the Cubs and Bears. And while it might be frowned on in Iowa City, I also cheer for University of Illinois athletics — go Illini!</p>

      <h3>Family Information</h3>
      <p>
        I come from a family based in Moline, Illinois. My mom and dad both live there, along with my sister who also calls Moline home. We have four amazing Labrador dogs: Theo, Pete, Hazel, and Baker. Pete is the newest addition — a playful puppy who’s quickly become part of the family. I named Theo, Baker, and Pete. Theo is named after Theo Epstein, the Cubs' president of baseball operations during their historic 2016 World Series win. Baker is inspired by Baker Mayfield, one of my favorite football quarterbacks. And Pete gets his name from Pete Crow-Armstrong, a rising star player for the Cubs.
