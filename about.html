    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <section>
      <p>I was born and raised in Moline, Illinois, and graduated from Moline High School in 2022.</p>

      <p>During high school, I played baseball competitively, which opened the door to continuing my athletic career at Black Hawk College, a local community college. I earned my associate degree there in the spring of 2024.</p>

      <p>Currently, I’m a senior at the University of Iowa, majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems.</p>

      <p class="callout-text">
        I chose Business Analytics because I love solving problems with data and uncovering patterns that others might miss.
      </p>

      <p>Outside the classroom, I’m a passionate Chicago sports fan, especially when it comes to the Cubs and Bears. And while it might be frowned on in Iowa City, I also cheer for University of Illinois athletics — go Illini!</p>

      <h3>Family Information</h3>
      <p>I come from a family based in <strong>Moline, Illinois</strong>. My mom and dad both live there, along with my sister who also calls Moline home.</p>

      <p>We have four amazing Labrador dogs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Theo</strong> – named after Theo Epstein, the Cubs' president of baseball operations during their historic 2016 World Series win.</li>
        <li><strong>Baker</strong> – inspired by Baker Mayfield, one of my favorite football quarterbacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Pete</strong> – named after Pete Crow-Armstrong, a rising star player for the Cubs.</li>
        <li><strong>Hazel</strong> – the fourth member of our Labrador crew.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Pete is the newest addition — a playful puppy who’s quickly become part of the family. I personally named Theo, Baker, and Pete.</p>
